## About Me
I am a Data Professional with experience in developing software products for data processing and end-end machine learning systems. Experienced in Python programming, PyTorch and Sagemaker ML frameworks. 

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on end-end text summarization with machine learning
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Airflow

## Projects

#### Sign Language video to text project
*In collaboration with Chi-Yun and Quing Zhu, [blog post](https://cyc-tw.medium.com/american-sign-language-translation-approach-using-machine-learning-3ae34c112d23)*

In this Capstone project, we implemented Convolution 3D and Encoder-Decoder neural network architectures to build models to detect and translate American Sign Language - ASL - from short videos.

Components:
- Processed video data from [How2Sign](https://how2sign.github.io/) database and TikTok.
- Built Convolution 3D model with 95% accuracy.
- Extracted pose, hands and face features with MediPipe Holistic
- Implemented Encoder-Decoder + Attention architecture.


#### Forecasting Energy demand with LSTM networks
*In collaboration with Hrafnhildur Arna Nielsen and Kamran Arshad, [blog post](https://medium.com/@garciaguerra.jl/forecasting-energy-demand-in-a-residential-building-with-lstm-neural-network-and-genetic-algorithms-49b0dc475c60)*

This is a class project where we used power consumption from a residential building and trained ML Neural Networks to forecast enery demand for the next seven days.

Components:
- Forecasted power demand for the next day given the previous seven days of power consumption.
- Implemented RNN-LSTM network architecture.
- Optimized hyper-parameters by implementing genetic algorithms

#### Decision Trees and Random Forests to predict solar energy production
*[Databricks](https://jgarcia2411.github.io/Jose-Garcia-Portfolio/documents/SOLAR_FINAL.html)*

In this project, I used solar energy production and solar radiation data to analyze and predict the amount of energy produced by a solar farm given the current weather and solar radiation conditions.

Components:
- Collected, cleaned and merged raw data from National Solar Radiation Database- [NSRDB](https://nsrdb.nrel.gov/)
- Trained ML models using distributed computing services in Databricks.
- Tracked ML experiments with Spark MLFlow library.
- Feature Engineered and Hyperparameter tunning using grid-search algorithms.
- Obtained R-squared:0.92 in predicting energy production
