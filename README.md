## About Me
I am a dynamic and versatile AI Software and Platform Engineer specializing in architecting and deploying scalable, intelligent systems. My expertise lies at the intersection of advanced machine learning and robust software development, driven by a passion for building cutting-edge AI solutions that solve complex enterprise challenges.

## My Core Expertise:
**- Building Intelligent AI Systems:** Building Intelligent AI Systems: I design, develop, and deploy high-performance AI applications, leveraging Agentic AI, Generative AI (LLMs), and advanced NLP techniques like Named Entity Recognition (NER), clustering, and classification. My focus is on automating complex processes, extracting critical insights from large datasets, and enhancing user experiences with data-driven and personalized solutions.

**- Architecting Robust AI Platforms & MLOps:** I specialize in creating scalable and efficient MLOps infrastructure. This includes designing microservices, RESTful APIs (FastAPI), serverless architectures (AWS Lambda, SageMaker, ECS), and establishing robust CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, Terraform) with automated testing (PyTest). I prioritize optimizing cloud resource utilization for seamless deployment and operation of AI models and agents.

## My Journey & Foundations:
**- Master of Science in Data Analytics** | [George Washington University](https://graduate.engineering.gwu.edu/master-science-data-analytics)
  - Deeply immersed in cutting-edge ML/AI methodologies, including architecting Deep Neural           Networks (PyTorch, TensorFlow) and leveraging distributed computing (Spark ML, Databricks)       on AWS EC2 for complex challenges.

**- From Engineering to AI:** My background as a **Petroleum Engineer** cultivated strong analytical thinking, meticulous data management skills, and a collaborative spirit in multidisciplinary teams. These foundations uniquely equip me to tackle intricate data challenges and deliver impactful solutions in the AI domain.
