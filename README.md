## About Me
### Engineer, Sofware Developer, and Machine Learning practitioner. 
I am a versatile professional with a strong background in software development and machine learning, backed by experience in reservoir engineering. 

üë®‚ÄçüöÄ **In my role as Software Developer**, I have refined my skills in software engineering, specializing in architecting and implementing scalable solutions using industry-leading tools such as like FastAPI, PyTest, Docker, and Jenkins. My focus has always been on delivering high-quality backend systems that meet the rigorous demands of enterprise software environments.

ü§ñ **In the realm of machine learning**, I have demonstrated proficiency in leveraging ML to streamline processes, reduce manual work expenses, and enhance data management efficiency. Whether it's summarizing course content or deriving actionable insights from customer inquiries, I leverage a comprehensive toolkit including GenAI, LMMs, SageMaker, Scikit-Learn, and AWS to develop and deploy ML models effectively. My experience encompasses model training, pipeline development, and serverless deployment, all geared towards achieving optimal performance and outcomes. 

üìö **During my Master of Science in Data Analytics** program at [George Washington University](https://graduate.engineering.gwu.edu/master-science-data-analytics), I immersed myself in cutting-edge technologies and methodologies, focusing on projects that tackled complex challenges in video processing and classification, as well as energy forecasting and prediction. I architected Deep Neural Networks using PyTorch and TensorFlow frameworks, harnessed the power of cloud computing resources with AWS EC2, and leveraged distributed computing resources through Spark ML and the Databricks platform.

ü§µ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **As a former Petroleum Engineer**, I honed my analytical skills and collaborative spirit, working seamlessly with multidisciplinary teams to analyze and interpret intricate data sets. My track record includes managing and curating datasets for forecasting and simulation tasks, as well as effectively communicating technical insights to stakeholders through various mediums.
